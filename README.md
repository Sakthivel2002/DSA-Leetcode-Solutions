# 🚀 JAVA DSA + LeetCode Solutions 

This repository contains my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** implementations and **LeetCode problem solutions** solved using Java. The goal is to practice problem-solving, track my progress, and create a reference for myself and others.


## 📂 Structure
- **DSA/** → Classic problems categorized by topic (Arrays, Strings, Recursion, Sorting, DP, Graphs, etc).
- **LeetCode/** → Solutions organized by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard).


## 🧩 Topics Covered
- Arrays & Strings  
- Recursion & Backtracking  
- Sorting Algorithms  
- Searching Algorithms  
- Linked Lists & Stacks & Queues  
- Trees & Graphs  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Greedy Algorithms  


## 🏆 LeetCode Progress
| Difficulty | Solved | Examples |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Easy       | 35    | Two Sum, Binary Search, Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array |
| Medium     | 18    | Search in Rotated Sorted Array, Find Peak Element, Find the Duplicate Number |
| Hard       | 4    | First Missing Positive, Search a 2D Matrix, Kth Smallest in Multiplication Table |


## 📘 How to Read
Each file includes:
- LeetCode number and Problem name
- My code solution
- Comments on **time & space complexity**
- Sometimes: multiple approaches (brute force + optimized)
